# sCCraper

A Python-based scraper for downloading CTF challenges and files from the [CyberChallenge.IT](https://cyberchallenge.it) or [Olicyber.IT](https://training.olicyber.it) platforms using their API.

This tool logs in with your credentials, fetches all available challenges, downloads the metadata and attached files, and organizes everything into a clean folder structure.

## 📌 TODO

- [ ] CLI support (e.g. `--email`, `--save-to`)
- [ ] Caching to avoid re-downloading
- [ ] Automatic `.env` support
- [ ] Logging (instead of `print()`)
